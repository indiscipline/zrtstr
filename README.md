Command line application for checking WAV-files for identical channels, detecting faux-stereo files generated by some audio-editing software and DAWs (such as old versions of Cubase). Outputs a true-mono WAV file on detection of faux-stereo. Takes left channel of the input file, writes in the same location with -MONO suffix in file name.

Developed using these wonderful crates:
[Hound](https://github.com/ruuda/hound) 
[Clap](https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs)

## Usage
Basically, provide zrtstr with input file as an argument, or run it from a directory full of target WAV files.
Full help available on `--help` switch.

## How does it work?
Zrtstr reads interleaved channel samples from a target stereo file one by one and compares left and right samples. If the difference is present (or higher than the threshold given in `--dither` mode) than file considered true-stereo and program tries to write a mono copy.

## How to build
Developed on Rust Nightly, but should build with stable or beta as well.
To build the code, run:

```
$ cargo build --release
```

and the executable will be in `target/release/zrtstr`.
